I'm Matthew Cocco - an undergraduate Information Technology and Systems student at the University of Texas at Dallas.

I spend a lot of time collecting and condensing information and develop websites.

I love [ZURB][ZURB]'s [Foundation framework][foundation], which makes web prototyping a breeze.

HTML/CSS is my bread and butter. I'm most familiar with Python, of the pleasant-to-program-in languages.

I'm learning Ruby on Rails, the [Ionic framework][ionic] and proper [Android][android] development.
