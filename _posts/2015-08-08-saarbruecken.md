**I made it!** 

I'm going to be in Saarbrücken, in the heart of Saarland, which is a Bundesland (state) of Germany on the Germany-France border. Paris is about two hours away by train.

Where's Saarbruecken? 

In the state of Saarland, which is in southwestern Germany.

Within Saarland, it's here:

## \#Host Family & Accommodations

My host family's great; they've got a house in the scenic [Altenkessel][link-altenkessel] quarter with decent access to public transit (one bus is a three minute walk; the other is about 10 minutes away).

I've got a private room with a queen-sized mattress and the classic german pillow/duvet combo; I've also got a dresser and a small couch.

Check out this view from my balcony:

My host family also has a pool, wonderfully *angenehm* in the 37C+ heat:

Public transit here is mainly busses (there is the one S-Bahn, but it only really goes a few places; not at all comparable to Berlin's U- and S-Bahn coverage), most of which operate at half-hourly or hourly intervals. I'm about a half-hour away from the city interior and forty-five minutes from the language school.

Read: planning ahead for travel into the city is required.

Without further ado, here's what happened this week:

## \#Language School

On Monday, we went straight into language school, starting every weekday at 8:30. Days usually end around 4PM (except on Fridays, where we're done at noon).

*Unterricht* (class) is conducted in sessions of one-and-a-half-hour sessions, broken up by thirty- or fifteen-minute breaks. A bit long, for my tastes (I prefer forty-five minute blocks with breaks in between; it helps me stay focused).

I'll adjust.

We have two instructors (conducting class completely *auf deutsch*, of course) and a tutor (he's something like a tour guide, local, and advocate for us in a non-instructional sense).

I'm under the impression that we're somewhat experienced students here, so while we have a foundational understanding of the language and can get by during the day-to-day, we're not at the discussing-politics-and-religion or writing-opinion-articles-for-the-newspaper level yet.

Here's a photo of the squad:

## \#Free Time

We spent a bit of time out and about this week. We celebrated a birthday with a picnic on the river, tried some of the local fare, and took part in some weekend festivities; according to my host family, they've got a fest nearly every weekend out here!

Crazy.

On the 31st of July, we took a tour with Johannes, our tutor - he showed us a bit of the city, including the city castle and Ludwigskirche:

On the 8th of August, we visited the Völklingen Ironworks, an old (mostly) decommissioned iron and steel processing facility. It's known here as the *Weltkulturerbe Völklinger Hütte*, and is one of the UNESCO World Heritage sites.

There was also an art gallery:
